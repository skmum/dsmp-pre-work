### Project Overview

 The project is for creating the Student Management System for the University of Data Science. The objective of the project from the student perceptive is to apply the Python concepts of mathematical operations,  list, dictionary and string operations to create a Student Management System and perform the tasks assigned by the University of Data Science.

In this project, two lists were given containing names of students studying in two classes. So the first task was to get a combined list of students.
Next task was to create a dictionary for a student listing subjects taken and marks obtained in each subject. Next step was to calculate the percentage obtained by the student. Next task was to find the Math Genius i.e. the student who topped Mathematics and the marks scored by him and to award him with a scholarship certificate. 

The project ended with identifying the Math Genius for the University of Data Science and awarding him a Scholarship Certificate.



### Learnings from the project

 I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project right from creating a student master-list to preparing marksheet for each student, finding their aggregate marks scored, percentage obtained, identifying the top scorer in a given subject and then printing a scholarship certificate for him / her. 
The specific Python concepts I learnt in this project were :
1. List operations -
    i) creating a list
    ii) adding an element to a list
   iii) concatenating the lists
   iv) appending an element to a list
   v) removing an element from a list
2. Dictionary operations -
   i) creating a dictionary { }with relevant  [ 'key' : 'value' ] pairs
  ii) finding maximum value
  iii) getting the key corresponding to the maximum value
3.String operations -
  i) splitting a string (full_name) into first name and last name
 ii) converting in upper case to print on the certificate


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The approach to do the project was to revise the concepts learnt, follow the steps mentioned in the problem to break the problem into task and mini-task, to write the code for each mini-task and do a trial run to see the output, check for any errors and exceptions, correct the code till the final output was as expected and then submit it.


### Challenges faced

 Since I am new to coding, translating the concepts learn into writing an actual code was a challenge. I overcame the same by re-visiting the concept learnts, the keywords, the syntax particularly the way in which the keywords, variable names, commands were written, list and dictionary formats and writing the code side-by-side and trying it on till it was free of any errors and exceptions. Even after getting a "successful code-on' message, I still got some message after submitting the code. There I learnt, even if the code was successful, there could some issue in getting the desired solution that needed further fine-tuning.


### Additional pointers

 It felt great to do my first ever Project in Python that gave me a feel of how projects are worked on by applying the various concepts learnt, by dividing the project into tasks, sub-task and mini-tasks and then writing a code for each of the mini-task, sub-task to get the final code or solution for the given problem!!
Thank you for reading my project submission!! Would appreciate your valuable feedback.
